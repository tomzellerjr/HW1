1. If we were interested in understanding summary statistics at a glance (minimum, maximum, etc.), how could you improve the display of the table?

>A quick solution would be to sort the data according to unemployment rate -- either ascending or descending from highest to lowest/lowest to highest. Other options, depending on what it is you want to emphasize, would be to group, or "bin" certain states together by region (e.g. Southeast, Southwest, Pacific, Midwest, Northeast, etc.) That would give you another point of comparison. 



2. Find three varied examples on the web that present tabular data in a different layout or in more visually compelling, complete, interactive or interesting ways.

>**The Kaiser Family Foundation
<br>Infant Mortality Rates, 2007-2009**<br>
[link](http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/infant-death-rate/) This table is similar to the Labor Dept. data, but it allows the user some measure of interactive manipulation (e.g. re-sorting the columns by death rate, or by state alphabetically, etc.)<br><br>**The Gallup Poll**<br>Gun Ownership in U.S., 2011<br>
[link](http://www.gallup.com/poll/150353/self-reported-gun-ownership-highest-1993.aspx) This is similarly simple tabular data presented graphically, which allows the viewer to immediately see the change in self-reported gun ownership over time. It's a cleaner presentation, but lacks an interactive element that would allow the viewer to explore the data a bit more deeply.<br><br>**Wikipedia**<br>List of countries by median age<br>
[link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_median_age) Allowing that this is a Wikipedia entry and the source material would need to be verified, the page displays a nice use of both geographic and tabular display of data. The map is not interactive, which would be useful. But the table further down is, allowing users to sort the data as needed to answer different questions.
